### An Analysis of Optimal Trajectories for Air Launched Single Stage Rockets
__Abstract:__
 The following report is an analysis of optimal orbital and suborbital trajectories for single stage rockets that were launched from the air. A time optimal model for orbital insertion was generated and launches from the air and ground were evaluated for several spacecraft.Additionally, range optimized flights were generated for air launched rockets and were compared with trajectories with differing launch angles. Overall, the mission of this paper is to investigate air launched rocketry through time and range optimized launch profiles.
